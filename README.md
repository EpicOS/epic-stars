# EpicStars
A project to create a directory of other open source projects that members of our group hope to contribute to some day. The main purpose is to help find projects to contribute to, and eventually to share links or comments about your contributions as a way to encourage others and help them get started too.

## [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)
Some interesting issues that are open right now for Bootstrap...
* [Creating a "Resources" page to feature books & videos](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/20772) - because it looks like something easy for a beginner to take on.
* [Within .form-inline, label isn't on the same line as its .input-group](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/20752) - because it's an interesting problem, but even more for the example of the discussion around the issue.
* [Best Projects workflow for y'all?](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/20721) - and this one is interesting in the way they are communicating between projects using issues.

## Programming Tools
* [Parse and Output TODOs and FIXMEs from your files](https://github.com/pgilad/leasot) - this currently does not have support for Java, which is annoying (esp. since otherwise the list is quite comprehensive). (ambitious variant: hook this up to Github)
